A booster juice cost $7 which is pretty expensive if you want a smoothie everyday. 

I have recently bought a blender. Below is my smoothie recipe:

1. 1 handful of each frozen fruits: mango, strawberry, and pineapple

2. 1 table spoonful of yogurt

3. 1 cup of ice

4. half cup of orange juice

5. 1 and a half table spoon of sugar
